# PoultryLink frontend — architecture & end-to-end test script

This is the frontend counterpart to `test.README.md`/`test2.README.md`. Those two test the Express API directly with curl; this one tests the same workflow through the actual Next.js app in a browser, using the pages and proxy routes described below.

## 1. Architecture

**Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router) + TypeScript + Tailwind + Framer Motion + TanStack Query + Zustand, styled as pixel-art shadcn/ui primitives.

**Pattern: BFF proxy.** The browser never talks to Express directly and never sees a JWT. Every client component calls this app's own `/api/*` route handlers; those route handlers call Express server-side and translate its access/refresh token pair into httpOnly cookies on this app's own origin.

```
Browser
  │  fetch("/api/orders/123/accept")      (same-origin, cookies auto-attached)
  ▼
Next.js route handler  (src/app/api/orders/[id]/accept/route.ts)
  │  authedExpressFetch("/orders/123/accept")   (reads cookie, adds Bearer header)
  ▼
Express API  (EXPRESS_API_URL, never exposed to the browser)
```

Key files:

| File | Job |
|---|---|
| `src/lib/api/config.ts` | `EXPRESS_API_URL`, cookie names/max-ages |
| `src/lib/api/server.ts` | `expressFetch` (public), `authedExpressFetch` (attaches token, auto-refreshes once on a real 401), `setAuthCookies`/`clearAuthCookies` |
| `src/lib/api/client.ts` | `apiFetch`/`apiFetchPaginated` — the only thing client components call |
| `src/store/auth-store.ts` | Zustand: `user`, `status`, `hydrate()` (calls `/api/auth/me` once on app load) |
| `src/middleware.ts` | Redirects to `/login` for `/profile`, `/orders`, `/messages`, `/admin`, `/listings/new` if there's no session cookie |

Role enforcement is real only on the Express side — every route checks role server-side regardless of what the frontend shows. The frontend's role checks (navbar links, the admin layout gate) are UX only, there to stop someone from staring at a dead end, not security boundaries.

## 2. Page map

```
/                              landing page
/register, /login, /verify-otp     auth
/marketplace                   browse listings (public)
/listings/[id]                 listing detail + place-order form (BUYER)
/orders                        buyer's order list
/orders/[id]                   shared order detail — every action lives here:
                                  accept/reject (FARMER/SUPPLIER, PENDING_ACCEPTANCE)
                                  pay (BUYER, ACCEPTED)
                                  dispatch + transporter ID (seller, PAID)
                                  cancel (BUYER, PENDING_ACCEPTANCE/ACCEPTED/AWAITING_PAYMENT)
                                  confirm-delivery (BUYER, OUT_FOR_DELIVERY/DELIVERED)
                                  dispute (either party, PAID/OUT_FOR_DELIVERY/DELIVERED)
                                  review (either party, COMPLETED)
/selling/listings               seller's listings + inline "create a farm" + "create a listing"
/selling/orders                 orders placed on the seller's listings
/delivering/deliveries          transporter dashboard (IN_TRANSIT/DELIVERED/FAILED buttons)
/payments/callback              Paystack redirect target
/mock-checkout/[reference]      mock-provider redirect target (simulate success/failed)
/admin                          dashboard stat tiles (ADMIN only)
/admin/disputes                 disputed orders, release-to-seller / refund-buyer
/admin/verification             KYC queue, filter by role + verification status
```

Each buyer/seller/transporter/admin page above now also has a navbar link once you're logged in as that role, so nothing past this point needs a typed URL.

## 3. One-time setup

**Backend** (repo root):
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```
Set `CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000` (the `.env.example` default of `5173` is for a Vite app — this frontend runs on 3000). Leave `PAYMENT_PROVIDER=mock` and `OTP_PROVIDER=console` for local testing — OTP codes print straight to this terminal, and the mock payment provider needs no real Paystack keys.
```bash
npm install
npm run prisma:migrate
npm run seed        # categories + 4 test accounts + a test farm/listing
npm run dev          # Express on :5000
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/`):
```bash
echo "EXPRESS_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api/v1" > .env.local
npm install
npm run dev          # Next.js on :3000
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`.

## 4. Test accounts (from `npm run seed`)

All four share the password `Test1234!` and can log in immediately — no OTP step needed, they're pre-verified by email.

| Role | Email | Verification status |
|---|---|---|
| BUYER | `buyer@test.poultrylink.dev` | PENDING |
| FARMER | `farmer@test.poultrylink.dev` | PENDING |
| TRANSPORTER | `transporter@test.poultrylink.dev` | PENDING |
| ADMIN | `admin@test.poultrylink.dev` | VERIFIED |

The farmer account already owns a farm ("Test Farm") with one listing ("Test Broiler Chickens", 100 birds, min order 5) — so step 1 below is already done for you.

The buyer, farmer and transporter all sit at `PENDING` on purpose: that's the real state every account is in the moment it verifies its email (see note in section 6), and it means `/admin/verification` has something to act on the first time you open it, rather than looking empty.

Run this with at least four browser profiles (or one browser + three incognito windows) so you can be logged in as four different roles at once — buyer, farmer, transporter, admin all need to act in the same order's lifecycle.

## 5. End-to-end test script

**As BUYER** (`buyer@test.poultrylink.dev`):
1. `/marketplace` → find "Test Broiler Chickens", open `/listings/[id]`, place an order within the min/max quantity.
2. `/orders` → confirm the new order shows `PENDING_ACCEPTANCE`.

**As FARMER** (`farmer@test.poultrylink.dev`):
3. `/selling/orders` → open the order, **Accept** it. Status moves to `ACCEPTED`.

**As BUYER:**
4. Open the same order from `/orders`, click **Pay**. You're redirected to `/mock-checkout/[reference]` — click "simulate success." Status moves to `PAID`.

**As FARMER:**
5. Reopen the order (now `PAID`) — a transporter-ID field appears. Paste the transporter test account's user ID (grab it from the `users` table, or wherever `/profile` ends up exposing it) and click **Mark as dispatched**. Status moves to `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY`.

**As TRANSPORTER** (`transporter@test.poultrylink.dev`):
6. `/delivering/deliveries` → the order appears. Click through **In transit** → **Delivered**.

**As BUYER:**
7. Reopen the order — **Confirm delivery** is now available. Click it. This is the step that triggers escrow release server-side; status moves to `COMPLETED`.
8. Leave a review on the same page.

**Dispute branch** (run this on a second order instead of continuing the one above, so you still have a clean completed order to show):
9. Repeat steps 1–6 on a fresh order. Once it's `OUT_FOR_DELIVERY` or later, either party opens it and clicks **Dispute**, giving a reason.

**As ADMIN** (`admin@test.poultrylink.dev`):
10. `/admin` → dashboard tiles should show the disputed-order count ticking up.
11. `/admin/disputes` → the order appears with its dispute reason. Click **Release to seller** on one test dispute and **Refund buyer** on another, so you've exercised both outcomes. Status becomes `COMPLETED` or `CANCELLED` respectively.
12. `/admin/verification` → the buyer/farmer/transporter test accounts show up under the `PENDING` filter by default. Click **Verify** on one and **Reject** on another to confirm both actions and the badge update.

That closes every status transition `OrderStatus` defines except `REJECTED` and `CANCELLING` — run a third throwaway order to hit **Reject** (farmer, while `PENDING_ACCEPTANCE`) and **Cancel** (buyer, before payment) if you want full enum coverage.

## 6. Known gaps (not a bug — just not built yet)

- No profile page UI (`GET/PATCH /users/me` has no screen) — profile data can only be seen/changed via the API directly right now.
- No forgot/reset-password flow — `/login`'s "forgot password" link 404s.
- Messaging and notifications have no UI, even though the backend models exist.
- `/market-prices` on the landing page is static sample data, not read from `MarketPrice` records.
- `PATCH /users/:id/active` (ban/reactivate) has a working proxy route (`/api/admin/users/[id]/active`) but no button anywhere yet.

## 7. If something that worked before suddenly doesn't

A few real failure modes already hit during this build, in case they recur:

- **A page 404s even though the file "exists."** Check it's actually under `src/app/...`, not `src/components/...` — only `src/app` is routed. This happened once with `orders/[id]/page.tsx`.
- **"Module not found" for an `@images/*` import locally but not on the machine that built it.** Switch to a relative import (`../../../images/...`) — the alias has been flaky across machines before.
- **An order action throws a role error that doesn't match the action you clicked.** Open the specific route file under `src/app/api/orders/[id]/<action>/route.ts` and check the Express path it actually calls — one of these was once copy-pasted with the wrong endpoint inside.
- **Deploy works locally but fails on Vercel/Render over a missing package.** Compare `git log` between the branch you're deploying and the branch you tested locally — a dependency commit sitting on one and not the other has caused this before.
- **A verification-status filter shows nothing.** New accounts land on `PENDING` the moment they verify their email, not `UNVERIFIED` — that state only exists for the few seconds before OTP verification, and an unverified account can't log in at all. Default any "needs review" filter to `PENDING`.
